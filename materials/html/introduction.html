<p>
In this experiment, you will make judgments about whether one sentence being true means that another <i>must be true</i>, <i>must be false</i>, or <i>could be true or false</i>.
</p>

<p>
Some sentences must be true at the same time. For instance, if (1) is true, (2) <i>must also be true</i>; if John hates that Mary is sick, Mary must be sick. Other sentences cannot be true at the same time. If (1) is true, (3) <i>must be false</i>; that is, if John hates that Mary is sick, then she must not be healthy.  
</p>

<ol>
<li>John hates that Mary is sick.</li>
<li>Mary is sick.</li>
<li>Mary is healthy.</li>
<li>John believes that Mary is sick.</li>
</ol>

Some sentences don't have either relationship. For instance, if (4) is true, (2) <i>could be true or false</i>; if John believes that Mary is sick, Mary very well could be healthy. Similarly, if (4) is true, (3) <i>could be true or false</i>; if John believes that Mary is sick, Mary very well could be sick.

<p>
In this experiment, you will make judgments about these sorts of relationships. On each trial, you will be given two sentences. Your job will be to say whether, if the first sentence is true, the second <i>must be true</i>, <i>must be false</i>, or <i>could be true or false</i>. To respond, you will press <b>1</b> for <i>must be true</i>, <b>2</b> for <i>could be true or false</i>, or <b>3</b> for <i>must be false</i>. Please make a response as quickly as possible.
</p>

<p>
The experiment will begin with four practice sentences to get you used to the task. After you respond to each, you will be told whether you got the question right. After the practice, we will move on to the experiment. During the experiment, you will not be given feedback, but the accuracy of your answers will be tabulated, so please read carefully.
