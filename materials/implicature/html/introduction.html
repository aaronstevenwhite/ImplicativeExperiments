When people are speaking, they often imply things beyond what their words strictly mean. In this experiment, you'll be given statements and asked to judge what someone making those statements is likely to be implying (if anything).
</p>

<p>
One instance of implying something beyond the strict meaning can be seen in (1). 
</p>

<ol>
<li>John was able to hit the bullseye three times in a row.</li>
<li>John hit the bullseye three times in a row.</li>
</ol>

<p>
Strictly speaking, (1) just says something about John's ability to hit the bullseye three times in a row, not necessarily whether he did it or not. In general, though, if someone says (1), they are probably implying that (2) is also true. In fact, in most cases, it would be pretty deceptive to say (1) if (2) <u>weren't</u> true.

<p>
In this experiment, you will make judgments about what a trustworthy person is likely to be implying in making a particular statement. On each trial, you will be given a statement and a question related to that statement. Your task will be to respond <i>yes</i>, <i>maybe or maybe not</i>, or <i>no</i> based on what someone is likely to be implying by making the statement. 
</p>

<p>
For instance, you might get the statement <i>John was able to hit the bullseye three times in a row</i> and the question <i>Did John hit the bullseye three times in a row?</i> In this case, you would respond <i>yes</i>, since someone that makes that statement is likely to be implying that John actually hit the bullseye three times in a row. If the statement were <i>John wasn't able to hit the bullseye three times in a row</i> and the question were the same, you would respond <i>no</i>.
</p>

<p>
You should reserve <i>maybe or maybe not</i> only for cases where it's unclear if someone is likely to be implying anything by the statement. For instance, if the statement were <i>It's plausible that John ate lunch</i> and the question were <i>Did John eat lunch?</i>, you might respond <i>maybe or maybe not</i>, since a person who makes that statement doesn't generally seem to be implying either that John did eat lunch or that he didn't. 
</p>

<p>
To give a response, you will press <b>1</b> for <i>yes</i>, <b>2</b> for <i>maybe or maybe not</i>, or <b>3</b> for <i>no</i>. Please respond as quickly as possible.
</p>

<p>
The experiment will begin with four practice sentences to get you used to the task. After the practice, we will move on to the experiment. Let's get started!
