When people are speaking, they often imply things beyond what their words strictly mean. In this experiment, you'll be given statements and asked to judge what someone making those statements is likely to be implying (if anything).
</p>

<p>
One instance of implying something beyond the strict meaning can be seen in (1). 
</p>

<ol>
<li>John was able to hit the bullseye three times in a row.</li>
<li>John hit the bullseye three times in a row.</li>
</ol>

<p>
Strictly speaking, (1) just says something about John's ability to hit the bullseye three times in a row, not necessarily whether he did it or not. In general, though, if someone says (1), they are probably implying that (2) is also true. In fact, in most cases, it would be pretty deceptive to say (1) if (2) <u>weren't</u> true. 
</p>

<p>
In this experiment, you will make judgments about what a trustworthy person is likely to be implying in making a particular statement. On each trial, you will be given a statement and a question about how likely something is to be true assuming that the statement is true. You'll indicate your response on a 1 to 7 scale, where 1 means <i>very unlikely</i> and 7 means <i>very likely</i>.
</p>

<p>
For instance, you might get the statement (1) and the question (3). In this case, you would give a response in the upper likelihood range 5-7, since someone that makes that statement is likely to be implying that John actually hit the bullseye three times in a row.
</p>

<ol start="3">
<li>How likely is it that John hit the bullseye three times in a row?</li>
</ol>

<p>
If the statement were (4) and the question were the same, you would give a response in the lower likelihood range 1-3.
</p>

<ol start="4">
<li>John wasn't able to hit the bullseye three times in a row.</li>
</ol>

<p>
You should reserve 3-5 likelihood responses only for cases where it's unclear if someone is likely to be implying anything by the statement. For instance, if the statement were (5) and the question were (6), you might respond with a 4, since a person who makes that statement doesn't generally seem to be implying either that Fred did leave or that he didn't. 
</p>

<ol start="5">
<li>Fred might have left already.</li>
<li>How likely it is that Fred left already?</li>
</ol>

<p>
The experiment will begin with 4 practice questions, after which you will receive 56 test questions.
