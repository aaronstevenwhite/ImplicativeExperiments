# ImplicativeExperiments

## Overview

This project contains materials, data, and analysis scripts for a large-scale contradiction detection experiment investigating implicative verbs (Karttunen 1971). These experiments were designed and run by [Aaron Steven White](http://aswhite.net) using [Ibex](http://code.google.com/p/webspr/). The experiment was hosted on [Ibex Farm](http://spellout.net/ibexfarm/) and deployed on [Mechanical Turk](https://www.mturk.com/mturk/). 

A small portion of this work was presented at the [Linguistics Society of America Annual Meeting 2015](http://www.linguisticsociety.org/event/lsa-2015-annual-meeting). A manuscript describing all the experiments found here is now available on [my website](http://aswhite.net) and in the `papers/` directory.

## Contents

### materials/

This directory contains all the materials needed to run the experiment. This includes item generation and Ibex templating scripts (`create_items.py`), the configuration files (`js/experiment.js`) generated by those scripts, and all the instructions given to participants during the experiments (in `html/`).

### data/

This directory contains the raw data file pulled from Ibex (`results.ibex`). `results.preprocessed` was generated from `results.ibex` using `preprocess.py` in the `analysis/` directory, which reformats the data and removes data from participants that did not officially submit a Human Intelligence Task (HIT) for this experiment.

### analysis/

This directory contains the analysis script for the manuscript found in `papers/` as well as a preprocessing script for use on the raw Ibex data.

### papers/

This directory contains a paper based on the data.
