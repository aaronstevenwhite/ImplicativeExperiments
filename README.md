# ImplicativeExperiments

## Overview

This project contains materials, data, and analysis scripts for a large-scale contradiction detection experiment investigating investigating implicative verbs (Karttunen 1971). These experiments were designed and run by [Aaron Steven White](http://aswhite.net) using [Ibex](http://code.google.com/p/webspr/). The experiment was hosted on [Ibex Farm](http://spellout.net/ibexfarm/) and deployed on [Mechanical Turk](https://www.mturk.com/mturk/). 

A small portion of this work was presented at the [Linguistics Society of America Annual Meeting 2015](http://www.linguisticsociety.org/event/lsa-2015-annual-meeting). Further presentations and a paper are in preparation.

## Contents

### materials/

This directory contains all the materials needed to run the experiment. This includes item generation and Ibex templating scripts (`create_items.py`), the configuration files (`js/items.js`) generated by those scripts, and all the instructions given to participants during the experiments (in `html/`).

### data/

This directory contains the raw data file pulled from Ibex (`results.ibex`) as well as two long-form CSV files (`results.preprocessed` and `results.filtered`). `results.preprocessed` was generated from `results.ibex` using `preprocess.py` in the `analysis/` directory, which reformats the data and removes data from participants that did not officially submit a Human Intelligence Task (HIT) for this experiment. `results.filtered` was generated from `results.preprocessed` using `filter.R` in the `analysis/` directory, which filters participants based on the distribution of their response reaction times.

### analysis/

This directory contains preprocessing (`preprocess.py`) and filtering (`filter.R`) scripts as well as an implementation (`model.py`) of various computational models of the contradiction detection task.
